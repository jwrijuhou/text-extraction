**AUTOMATED PERSONAL LOAN DOCUMENT PROCESSING**
This project is a *Streamlit web application* that automates the processing of personal loan documents using *OCR (Optical Character Recognition)*. The app extracts readable text from uploaded scanned images of loan documents (like ID proofs, income statements, etc.).

## Features

- Upload personal loan document images (JPG, JPEG, PNG)
- Preprocess images using OpenCV for better OCR accuracy
- Extract text from documents using Tesseract OCR
- Display extracted data in a simple UI
- Easy to extend with field detection (like name, address, income)

## Technologies Used

- *Python*
- *Streamlit* – for UI
- *OpenCV* – for image preprocessing
- *Pytesseract* – for OCR
- *NumPy* – for handling image data
